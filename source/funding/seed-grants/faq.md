## Questions about Eligibility
### Can a Visiting Full-Time Assistant Professor apply?
Yes.
### Can a grad student apply?
For larger projects that involve faculty, students can apply as the principle investigator, but in general we encourage students to apply for the Graduate Student Fellowships.
### Are the Digital Humanities Seed Grant open to applications from NYU Shanghai faculty? 
Yes, the program is open to all global campus applications.
### Do I have to be in the Humanities to apply for a DH Seed Grant?
As long as the project demonstrates digital humanities engagement and methods, the opportunity is open to scholars in any department.

## Questions about Applications
Questions about project viability and scoping can be directed to [dh.help@nyu.edu](mailto:dh.help@nyu.edu)
### How long should the application be?
Proposals should not exceed three pages, plus a single-page budget summary, and any necessary letters of commitment.
### What does the application need to include?

- Abstract (200 words, may be used in publicity materials)
- Research agenda
- Environmental scan 
- Work plan
- Human subjects plan if the work would require IRB (note that most humanities research will not).
- List of participants
- Sustainability plan
- Future agenda 
- Single page budget
- letters of commitment

### What should my work plan include?
A timeline of the agenda to be pursued, including key dates and milestones. Preference is given to projects that scope the work to the time available.

### What is a sustainability plan?
You should explain how digital assets created by this project will be managed and preserved. For a sense of full sustainability plans, see statements from NEH and IMLS. Applicants are encouraged to consult with Digital Scholarship Services about the feasibility of any plans. A preference will be given to projects that make any resources (scholarship, code, or data) openly available unless they give a justification here of the ways such openness would be detrimental to individuals or communities.

## Budget Questions
### Do you have a sample budget?
We recommend that you model your budget on the grants that you aim to apply to. For instance, you could check out the [budget recommendations from the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/blog/planning-your-dh-institute-outcomes-and-budgets). The National Institute of Health (NIH) provides resources to [Develop Your Budget](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/format-and-write/develop-your-budget.htm). We also encourage you to check out NYU's [Office of Sponsored Programs tools for proposal development](https://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/sponsored-programs/proposal-development.html).

### How much money can you ask for?
Grants may range in size between $5,000 and $20,000. Collaborative projects are encouraged, but must include at least one NYU faculty member in the humanities. Final awards may be altered at the recommendation of the evaluation committee

### What sort of expenses are allowed?
Permissible expenses include student stipends, course buy-outs, partial summer salary, and specific equipment, server time, or hosting. 

### How do you hire a student?
For many departments, NYU facilitates student hiring with the [Handshake](https://nyu.joinhandshake.com/login) web application. If your department doesn't have its own Handshake account, ask your department administrator about best practices.
### How much do I need to budget for a student worker?
For the grad student worker, assuming that it will be an NYU student, you must include an additional 30% for overhead (health insurance, etc). For example, if you have a student working 10 hours at $20/hour, you'd put down $260 ($200 in wages + $60 in overhead).

### How do you hire an outside worker?
Hiring outside of NYU is different from department to department. In some cases, you need to go to your department Human Resources. There may be additional requirements to go through paperwork to hire contractors or vendors. If you know you will be looking to hire someone specific, we encourage you to speak with your department when you create your budget.

### Will funded projects have access to NYU's technologies, software copyrights, and receive technological assistance, or should the budget include the purchase of all of the aforementioned items?

This program is eager to fund projects that expand the use of various services provided by NYU's research technology. In many cases outside collaborators working with NYU teams are able to to create--for example--accounts within the NYU HPC cluster with cost. Experts from NYU libraries and from NYU research technology are made available for consultation, but programs needing software developers must budget for them. 

### Are there things I can’t pay for with the DH Seed Grant funding?
Personal computer purchases are not permitted.
All expenditure must be in compliance with University, School or Department fiscal regulations, whichever is most stringent.

## Questions about grant expectations

### Are there responsibilities after the grant period ends?
Grantees will give two short presentations to the NYU committee, either as part of a panel at the Center for the Humanities or in some other agreed-upon setting. One of the presentations will be a five-minute talk at the fall Digital Humanities Showcase. Grantees will also provide a short white paper outlining the project’s successes, failures, and future potential.

Additionally, grantees who receive funding may be called upon to serve on the review panel the following year.

### What sort of next steps do you expect?
The future agenda in your application should describe the goals for this project beyond the granting period. This may include relevant granting programs for a larger version, a description of the impact or future use of resources created in the grant period. Projects will be given preference that hold promise to expand NYU’s institutional capacity to support and create high-quality Digital Humanities research. How do you plan to sustain the results of the project beyond the funding period?
