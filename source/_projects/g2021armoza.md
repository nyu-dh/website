abstract: 'The publication of Mark Twain’s autobiography 100 years after his death
  presents a difficult proposition for the reading public with an unwieldy size of
  over 2000 pages. The work also presents an opportunity for computational text analysis
  to provide insights where more traditional close readings of it might prove difficult.
  My dissertation, “The Art of Literary Modeling”, demonstrates new scholarly activities
  that provide context sensitive, evidentiary bases for making interpretive claims
  from computational models of literature. Its first chapter answers the question,
  "What does it mean to read literature as data?" That chapter''s discussion of "literary"
  data quality looks to versions of Emily Dickinson''s poetry amid her multiple, posthumous
  publications. It adapts data quality metrics from information science to provide
  an overall assessment of those digital versions, and produces a new collection of
  poems that reflect their data quality with respect to her oeuvre. This next chapter
  will answer the followup question: "What does it mean to model literature as data?"
  Applying standards for model selection and quality analysis from statistics known
  as "information criterion" reveals differences between various models of a work.
  That comparison made possible by information criteria presents a new, qualitative
  decision point for the study of literature as data. By looking to passages of Twain’s
  autobiography noted by high quality models of it and then further assessing them
  with scholarly understandings of those passages, it becomes possible to produce
  new findings on the autobiography and sound methodology for model quality generalizable
  to humanities research beyond this project.'
