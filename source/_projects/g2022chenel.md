abstract: 'We make sense of the spatial world around us by dividing it into smaller
  units with distinguishable names. If a group exercises more power over another in
  the region, they may replace these placenames by those in their language. Erased
  from official records and maps overnight, where do former placenames go? The Directory
  of Placenames Unforgotten (DOPU) aims to create an online, collaborative platform
  where the linguistic heritage of underrepresented groups can be preserved. Focusing
  on former placenames in endangered languages of the Black Sea, this project collects
  placename submissions and presents its collection in an easily manageable way that
  benefits those who may be interested in the general or specific findings of this
  project. All features and findings of this project will be accessible via the DOPU
  website. These features include submission forms that allow for single or multiple
  entries at once; a sortable and searchable collection where each entry is described
  in over 20 categories; and a series of static and dynamic maps that visualize these
  placename changes by density, origin language, target language, and timeframe overall
  and in smaller demarcations. The expected number for the initial set of entries
  is 2000, extracted from over 600 primary sources I accumulated in my former research
  and fieldwork, which can be visualized in as many maps as necessary. This project
  does not offer conclusions of its own but functions as a source for those tracing
  the increasing monolingualism of Black Sea-states and erasure of linguistic minority
  heritage from nationalist landscapes. '
