abstract: 'The Zine Union Catalog (aka ZineCat) is a union catalog dedicated to zines.
  A union catalog is a resource where libraries can share cataloging and holdings
  information. ZineCat lets researchers discover zine holdings by searching a single
  catalog, helps librarians copy catalog records to eliminate duplication of cataloging
  effort, and facilitates lending across libraries. ZineCat serves educators, researchers,
  librarians, archivists, and anyone in the general public with an interest in zines.
  Zines – self-published literature that often features counter cultural, political,
  and artistic content – are an increasingly important primary resource for humanities,
  social sciences, and other scholars, but due to the diverse standards and practices
  among the libraries, archives, and community organizations that collect and maintain
  them, accessing them through traditional research discovery systems is difficult.
  The initial prototype was developed by Lauren Kehoe (Faculty Librarian, NYU) and
  Jenna Freedman (Librarian, Barnard) in their MA Digital Humanities program at the
  City University of New York Graduate Center using 25 records from three libraries
  with different metadata schema: MARC, Dublin Core, and a spreadsheet-based standalone
  schema to a Collective Access catalog. The prototype has grown to include over 31,000
  zines from six collections.'

  They make systems to suffice
  They can’t easily splice
