abstract: 'The proposed Archive of Cuban Socialism (ARCHCUS) will document and archive
  the material culture of everyday life in Cuba between 1959 and 1990. It builds on
  an existing blog, Cuba Material, which will be expanded into a comprehensive, interactive,
  systematic, and user-friendly platform. Cuba Material has been a multi-year effort
  at the community and academic level to preserve and make available to scholars and
  other interested parties information regarding the common goods, fabrics, objects
  and uniforms, among other material objects, that circulated in Cuba following the
  1959 Revolution. Both the objects and meanings (social, political, aesthetic) will
  be preserved in digital form for documentation and study. The innovative web platform
  will catalogue objects, male them easily searchable, host digital exhibitions, and
  provide mechanisms for additional contributions from the community, contextualization,
  and discussion. This makes it a significant contribution to the study of contemporary
  material culture as well as to Cuban, Caribbean, Latin American, and state socialist
  studies. '
