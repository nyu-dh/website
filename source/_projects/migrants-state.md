abstract: This upcoming project received a 2023 Digital Humanities Advancement Grant
  from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The project will create a
  digital prototype that will develop open source machine learning techniques for
  image segmentation and classification to facilitate expanded access to large sets
  of heterogeneous government files. It will develop a robust metadata schema for
  a set of historical migrant records held by the U.S. National Archives (NARA) gathered
  in what are known as A-files (formerly Alien Files). A-files are in essence portfolios
  that are generated by the state for migrants, immigrants, or refugees who enter
  the U.S. and in the process come into contact with border control agencies. They
  contain a wide variety of documentation specific to the individual migrant’s life
  story and migration history. Historical A-files are in the public domain, but are
  currently accessible only by request from NARA, on a file-by-file basis. Searchability
  is limited to a few categories such as country of origin and date of birth. M/S
  will use a corpus of 550 A-files gathered prior to the grant period through NARA
  file requests (which we estimate contain 20,000-25,000 pages of documents in total)
  to model new methods of digital access to large collections of government records.
  Access will be facilitated and expanded through the segmentation of documents, identification
  of document types, and the addition of detailed metadata about document types (e.g.
  government forms, correspondence, employment records, etc.). This level of indexing
  will make the diverse contents of the files discoverable by social, political, and
  geographical criteria. It will enable researchers to locate specific topics such
  as policing and detention, medical care, employment, or types and outcomes of legal
  proceedings. As transnational records, A-files will shed new light on immigration
  history in the U.S., the history of migrants’ home countries, and the often understudied
  ways in which the two interconnect.
