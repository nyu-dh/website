abstract: 'This project is a catalyst for access to open Villa La Pietra’s rich collection
  of over 6000 objects dating from the 17th to 20th centuries for audiences with disabilities.
  Working at the intersection of Museum Studies and Computer Science, Historic Fractures:
  Toward A Digital Future in Museum Accessibility leverages inclusive design practices
  and digital technology to make historic house museums accessible. Faculty members
  from Museum Studies and Computer Science conduct original field research at Villa
  La Pietra with students to lead content and development for the creation of three
  digital modules designed for a range of visitors with disabilities: 1) an augmented
  reality platform that integrates historical and archival photography to create a
  guided tour for visitors that are deaf or have low levels of hearing 2) a relational
  database of signatures that trace connected histories of early 20th c. visitors
  3) implementation of a selected museum object from Villa La Pietra’s collection
  for visitors that are blind or have low vision. By training the next generation
  of computer scientists and museum scholars as highly-informed advocates for audiences
  with diverse motor, cognitive, sensory, and behavior-emotional disabilities, this
  project supports tactical and strategic skills to develop multi-sensory content
  in historic houses.'
