subtitle: Multimedia Sourcebook of the 1990s
category: Externally Funded
abstract: Following the collapse of the Soviet regime, Russia seemed poised to develop
  a robust public sphere. This unprecedented moment coincided with the global digital
  revolution, in particular the advent of the Internet — a resource whose immediate
  mobilization by wealthy political influencers epitomized the fragility of Russia’s
  newly liberated media commons. This project, funded by a NEH Collaborative Research
  Grant, investigates the encounter of the mainstream with the fringe, of ideologues
  and idealists, of dazzling creativity and rank commercialism in post-Soviet Russophone
  print, television, Web 1.0, and radio media. By preserving, interrogating, and (re-)interpreting
  key artifacts from the “long 1990s,” which began with Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost’
  in 1986 and ended with the election of Vladimir Putin in 2000, our curated collection
  sheds light on a remarkable, if short-lived, period in recent Russian history.
