abstract: 'As COVID-19 began to dominate the global agenda during the spring of 2020,
  museums, libraries, and archives around the world announced efforts to document
  human experiences of illness, isolation, economic downturn, fear, adaptation, and
  solidarity. These efforts ranged widely in scale and methods, from local historical
  societies seeking personal reflections to large scale federally-funded oral history
  projects. What will become of these various collecting efforts, and how will scholars
  be able to locate them effectively? The COVID Collections Project aims to catalogue
  the many COVID-19 oral history, documentation, and archiving projects that have
  begun since winter 2020. As a multi-year project, we have started to survey repositories
  and oral historians to discover and catalogue the collections that are being built
  around the global experience of COVID-19. We will then develop a website that will
  help researchers find these collections. We also hope to foster collaborations among
  archivists, documentarists, and historians as the collections are being developed.
  The COVID Collections Project is a collaboration among the Initiative for Critical
  Disaster Studies (NYU Gallatin), the Archives and Public History Program (NYU GSAS),
  and the E.L. Quarantelli Resource Collection at the University of Delaware’s Disaster
  Research Center. '

  Last year too many groups started selection
  of COVID stuff, sans introspection
  Since their sustainability's porous,
  That leaves an opening for us
  to make a covid collection, collection.
