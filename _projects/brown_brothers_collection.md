abstract: The Brown Brothers Collection is a collaborative, cross-institutional research
  project that will develop robust teaching, research, and public humanities resources
  that leverage the digitized Brown Brothers & Company archives held by the New York
  Public Library.  Founded in 1825 by Irish immigrants, this New York bank remains
  in operation as one of the largest private financial services firms in the city,
  Brown Brothers Harriman. An initial phase of collection’s digitization was recently
  completed with support from a Hidden Archives grant. We anticipate many kinds of
  stories that might be told from this collection, ranging from the history of global
  finance capital and the New York banking sector to New York City’s financial and
  administrative role in the slave economy. This pilot seeks to create a dataset and
  machine-readable transcriptions encompassing the contents of the original records,
  and to develop potential uses of the data by scholars, teachers, and the general
  public as an open-access resource.
